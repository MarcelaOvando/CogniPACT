# Cognitive Parcellation of Association and Commissural Tracts - Cognipact

This repository contains the scripts used for the creation of Cognipact and all analyses reported in the manuscript: 

# Unveiling the functional specialisation of human circuits with naturalistic stimuli (Ovando-Tellez M., Foulon C, Nozais V.,Pacella V. & Thiebaut de Schotten M.)

Specifically, you will find:

- Scripts to create UMAP embeddings from the group-level temporal variation series of white matter voxels.

- Scripts to perform HDBSCAN clustering on the UMAP embeddings.

- Scripts to generate null (randomized) UMAP embeddings for statistical comparison.

- Scripts to calculate Euclidean distance matrices from UMAP embeddings and compare spatial distributions.

- Scripts to generate random parcellations and calculate the homogeneity scores.

- Scripts to build the morphospace of white matter functional organization.

All scripts include comments and instructions to facilitate replication and further exploration.
