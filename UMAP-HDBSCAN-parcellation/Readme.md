# This folder contains scripts for dimensionality reduction, clustering validation, null model generation, and distance metrics between embedding spaces. 

This folder includes:

1. UMAP Embedding and HDBSCAN applied for association and commissural fibers (final_asso_UMAP_hdbscan.ipynb and final_comm_UMAP_hdbscan.ipynb)

2. Clustering with HDBSCAN and validation with DBCV (DBCV_calculation.py)

3. Null model generation (RandomUMAP.py)
   
4. Euclidean distance between UMAPs (eucledian_UMAP.py)
